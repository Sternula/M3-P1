> *"Populations of feral cats are large, have high intrinsic rates of growth, and are highly adaptable to different and sometimes harsh habitats."* [Foley et al. (2005)](https://www.avma.org/News/Journals/Collections/Documents/javma_227_11_1775.pdf)

A cat owner, a politician, a conservation biologist, an animal control officer and an animal rights activist sat down at a table together. This sounds like the start of a bad joke, but it's a sampling of the range of stakeholders with interests in the management of feral cat populations. Each of you has been assigned a "role" to play in this problem case. Each role has a value statement, and an objective.

1^st Class Session
  1. View the video "Trap-Neuter-Release"
  2. Gather in "Role Groups"---review your value statements and objectives.
  3. Reorganize into normal management teams---review the information, set learning objectives, define management options.
  
2^nd Class Session
  * Discuss logistic population model and translate options into dynamics. Assign groups to evaluate each option in spreadsheet.
  
3^rd Class Session
  * Groups report to class on outcomes for each management option.

**Issues:**

- Feral cats have diseases such as rabies, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus, and Feline Leukemia that can be transmitted to domestic cats.

- Cats (feral and domestic) are the definitive host to *Toxoplasma*, a protozoan parasite that can infect humans by contact with cat feces. 3500 infants are born in the US in a year with severe infections.

- There were 137 reported cat bites in FY 2003--2004. Stray or unlicensed cats account for ~70% of bites.

- Cats mostly eat small rodents. Rodents can transmit diseases to humans (*Hantavirus*, *Tularemia*).

- Estimates of native fauna consumed vary---but clearly not zero.

- It is estimated that trapping, sheltering, and euthanizing a cat costs $80 / animal [(Alley Cat Allies)](http://www.alleycat.org), while TNR costs are typically estimated ~$25 / animal using volunteer veterinary services, trappers and transporters. A $3000 pilot TNR program in Lincoln neutered 10 cats.

- Feeding feral cats increases the "carrying capacity" of the habitat.

- \>95% of licensed cats in Lincoln are neutered.
